You have no idea how many people have asked me for the VCC source.

Well, here it is. There's not much to say about it.. I did get a few ideas
from the QuakeC Compiler source released by id software, however when you study
VC and QC, the two are so completely different that it's not even funny. The
main things that I 'borrowed' from the QCC source are parts of the lexical
parsing routines, but even those are quite starkly different than QCC's.

I'm very proud of this piece of work, and unlike the VERGE and MAPED sources,
this one will compile with NO warnings; unless of course you turn on -wall, but
if anyone complains to me about that I will proceed to smack their face in.

I've compiled it under DJGPP, Watcom for DOS, Watcom as a Win32s console app,
and Visual C++ as a Win32s console app, all with NO source modifications
whatsoever. I imagine it should compile under linux with little or no
modifications as well.

As I've mentioned before, the preprocessor (preproc.c) was written by zeromus
(zeromus@flash.net), not myself.

Have fun.
